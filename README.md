# Sumo-Battle
Try to stay in the ring while knocking enemies off!  Use WASD to move the camera around and control yourself (the black sphere).  The goal is to have the enemy white spheres fall off the map as they arrive in waves of increasing number.  Stay on the lookout for power ups as well that give you a huge boost in bumping power against your enemies. 
To open the game in Unity first clone the repository.  Then go into Unity hub and open the main folder containing all the files.  The game should then open in Unity and you can press the Unity play button to play the game!
This game was made in Unity using C#
